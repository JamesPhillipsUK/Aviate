# Aviate #

Aviate is an ultra-lightweight text-editor designed for UNIX-like systems.

Aviate is a recursive acronym, which stands for: "Aviate Verifiably Is A Text Editor".  The Aviate Project started in April 2016.  Aviate is so lightweight because it consists simply of a single script - written in C - which handles file I/O and text editing.  Put simply: once you have the software installed, navigate to the directory you want to use, then run the program.

## How to Install Aviate ##

1. Download the release you want from GitHub, I always suggest running the [latest release](https://github.com/JamesPhillipsUK/Aviate/releases "Find all of the releases here!").  If you have Git installed, you can use `git clone git://github.com/JamesPhillipsUK/Aviate`.
2. Open a terminal session in the Aviate file you've downloaded (you'll need to uncompress the .zip or .tar.gz if you've downloaded it from the web).
3. From your terminal, run "`$ sudo make`".

- N.B: Superuser or "sudo" priviliges will usually be needed to compile the software.

## How to use Aviate ##

To use Aviate, follow these simple instructions, and you'll be on your way:

1. To start writing a new file, use the command: "`Aviate Write x.y`" in your Bash terminal.
2. To read or write to a pre-existing file, use: "`Aviate Read x.y`".
3. To save your work, use: `[F1]`.  To Exit, use `[F2]`.

## Bug-finding ##

I hope you don't have too many problems with Aviate, but as with everything in it's early stages there may be some teething problems.  If you do find any bugs, please report them as issues in the GitHub repo, no matter how small.
