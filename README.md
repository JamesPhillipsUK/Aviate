# Aviate
Aviate is an ultra-lightweight text-editor designed for UNIX-like systems.

## What is it?
Aviate, the ultra-lightweight, single-script, terminal text-editor for UNIX-like systems.  Aviate is a recursive acronym, which stands for: Aviate Verifiably Is A Text Editor.  The Aviate Project started in April 2016, under the title MyProg.

> MyProg is a working title.  It stands for My Program, because that's all it is.  Put simply, MyProg is so lightweight because it consists simply of a single script, written in C, which handles file I/O and text editing.  Put simply, once you have the software installed, navigate to the directory you want to use, then run the program.

## How do I install it?
1. Download the version (Branch) you want from GitHub. 
2. Open a terminal session in the myprog file.
3. From your terminal, run "`$ sudo make`". 
- N.B: Superuser or sudo priviliges are needed to decompile the software. 

## How do I use it?
Aviate works on a similar principle to other command-line tools you may be familiar with, such as GNU Nano in that you can call the software from inside any directory.  Once you open the program, you'll be asked where to save it.  If you want to, you can even choose to save it in a sub-directory.  Once you've chosen where to save it, just press enter to start editing.  To finish editing, double-tap [ENTER].

## I've found a bug.  What do I do?
I hope you don't have too many problems with Aviate, but as with everything in it's early stages there may be some teething problems.  If you do find any bugs, please report them, no matter how small.  You can report them in two ways, either: report them on GitHub, or report them directly to me at: [jamesphillipsuk.com/Contact](http://jamesphillipsuk.com/Contact/ "Contact me!").
