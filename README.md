# Aviate #

Aviate is an ultra-lightweight text-editor designed for UNIX-like systems.

## What is it? #

Aviate, the ultra-lightweight, single-script, terminal text-editor for UNIX-like systems.  Aviate is a recursive acronym, which stands for: Aviate Verifiably Is A Text Editor.  The Aviate Project started in April 2016, under the title MyProg.

> MyProg is a working title.  It stands for My Program, because that's all it is.  Put simply, MyProg is so lightweight because it consists simply of a single script, written in C, which handles file I/O and text editing.  Put simply, once you have the software installed, navigate to the directory you want to use, then run the program.

## How do I install it? #

1. Download the release you want from GitHub, I always suggest running the latest release.
2. Open a terminal session in the Aviate file.
3. From your terminal, run "`$ sudo make`".
- N.B: Superuser or sudo priviliges are needed to decompile the software.

## How do I use it? #

To use Aviate, follow these simple instructions, and you'll be on your way:

1. To start writing a new file, use the command: "`Aviate Write x.y`" in your Bash terminal.
2. To read or write to a pre-existing file, use: "`Aviate Read x.y`".
3. Once Aviate has started, to cut your current line of text, use: `[CTRL]+K`.  To paste, use: `[CTRL]+U`.
4. To save your work, use: `[CTRL]+O\`.  To Exit, use `[CTRL]+X`.

## I've found a bug.  What do I do? ##

I hope you don't have too many problems with Aviate, but as with everything in it's early stages there may be some teething problems.  If you do find any bugs, please report them as issues in the GitHub repo, no matter how small.
